# **App Name**: Simple Hello

## Core Features:

- Text Display: Display the 'Hello World' text.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted blue (#748DA6) to evoke a sense of calmness and simplicity. A slightly desaturated blue adds a touch of modernity without being overwhelming.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F4F8), nearly white, to create a clean and unobtrusive backdrop. 
- Accent color: Muted indigo (#5C6B8A). Provides a subtle contrast and complements the primary color.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look, is suitable for body text and headlines. The content here is suitable for either.
- Simple, centered layout with generous whitespace.
